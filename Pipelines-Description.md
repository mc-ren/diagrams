# Pipelines-Description

This document describes the implementation of the concepts found in the CI/CD Deployment standards document and in the deployment environments document. The goal of this document is to describe the stages as implemented and show them in use in the Azure DevOps UI. The stages should be common across pipelines but the physical azure-pipelines.yml files may be different based on the applications they are supporting. Our pipelines focus on making every part of the process of building, deploying, testing, and releasing software visible to everyone involved. We strive for a repeatable process for all application artifacts. All changes should be automated through our deployment pipeline.
